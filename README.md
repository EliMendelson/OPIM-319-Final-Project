Trading Clusters

- board with variety of agents
	- 2 resources
	- each agent has knowledge of 2 resources
		- accuracy of knowledge is dependent on distance from the resources
	- grouping agents within certain boundaries
- we want to study if agents of any given group will develop trade relationships with other particular groups (for example, would the group with 60% knowledge of one resource and 40% of the other trade with the 40%/60% group)
